# NISR_Hackathon_Dashboard
My NISR Dashboard
What data does it use?
What insights is it trying to communicate? 
What are the main functionality and user interface decisions that you've made?

I have used the CPI data to make a dashboard which shows how different sectors of the economy have been impacted by changes in prices. 

I chose to use RShiny because I have experience in R before, and I thought that the UI looked nicer than the alternatives. I chose these colours for these reasons.
